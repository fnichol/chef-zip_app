# Description

LWRP to install Mac OS X applications from zip archives.

# Requirements

## Chef

Tested on 0.10.2 but newer and older version should work just fine. File an
[issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

## Platform

Only for `node[:platform] == "mac_os_x"` platforms. Tested on Mac OS X 10.7
(Lion) and 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).

## Cookbooks

There are **no** external cookbook dependencies.

# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install zip_app

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'zip_app',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-zip_app.git', :ref => 'v0.2.0'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-zip_app/v0.2.0

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-zip_app.git cookbooks/zip_app
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-zip_app/tarball/v0.2.0 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-zip_app-* zip_app

# Usage

Simply include `recipe[zip_app]` in your run_list and the
`zip_app_package` resource will be available.

To use `recipe[zip_app::data_bag]`, include it in your run_list and have a
data bag called `"apps"` with an item called `"mac_os_x"` like the following:

    {
      "id"        : "mac_os_x",
      "zip_apps"  : [
        { "name"        : "iTerm",
          "source"      : "http://iterm2.googlecode.com/files/iTerm2_v1_0_0.zip",
          "checksum"    : "2afad022b1e1f08b3ed40f0c2bde7bf7cce003852c83f85948c7f57a5578d9c5"
        },
        { "name"        : "Divvy",
          "source"      : "http://mizage.com/divvy/downloads/Divvy.zip"
        }
      ]
    }

Alternatively, you can override the data bag and item by setting the
`node['zip_app']['data_bag']` attribute to some like:

    node['zip_app']['data_bag'] = ['apps', "workstation-mac"]

# Recipes

## default

Processes a list of *zip_apps* (which is emtpy by default) to be installed.

Use this recipe when you have a list of apps in `node['zip_app']['apps']` or
when all you need is the `zip_app_package` LWRP.

## data_bag

Fetches an list of *zip_apps* from a data bag item and appends it to the
`node['zip_app']['apps']` attribute for processing. This recipe then includes
the default recipe, so there is no need to explicitly include `recipe[zip_app]`.

Use this recipe when you want data bag driven data in your workflow.

# Attributes

## `apps`

An array of zip_app hashes. The keys in the hashes correspond to the attributes
passed to the `zip_app_package` LWRP. For example:

    node['zip_app']['apps'] = [
      { 'name'      => 'iTerm',
        'source'    => 'http://iterm2.googlecode.com/files/iTerm2_v1_0_0.zip',
        'checksum'  => '2afad022b1e1f08b3ed40f0c2bde7bf7cce003852c83f85948c7f57a5578d9c5'
      },
      { 'name'      => 'GitHub',
        'source'    => 'https://github-central.s3.amazonaws.com/mac/GitHub%20for%20Mac%201.0.6.zip',
        'checksum'  => '1e95b3c16915efe171e53c2de31ae5b0b45cca6689a6923baa96cf754a06ed73'
      }
    ]

The default is an empty Array: `[]`.

## `data_bag`

The data bag and item containing a list of apps to be installed.. This is used
by the `data_bag` recipe. The default is `['apps', node['platform']]`.

### Actions

Action    |Description                   |Default
----------|------------------------------|-------
install   |Download and extract the `*.app` application into the destination directory. |Yes
### Attributes

Attribute   |Description |Default value
------------|------------|-------------
app         |**Name attribute:** The name of the installed application. For example, if the application to be installed was "/Application/GitHub.app" then the value would be `"GitHub"`. |`nil`
source      |The source URL of the zip archive. |`nil`
checksum    |(optional) The SHA-256 checksum of the file. If the local file matches the checksum, Chef will not download it. |`nil`
destination |The base path to where the application will be installed. |`"/Applications"`
zip_file    |(optional) The zip file name if it differs from the the last path fragment in the `source` URL. |`nil`
installed   |(internal) |`false`

### Examples

#### Install Basic App

    zip_app_package "Divvy" do
      source  "http://mizage.com/divvy/downloads/Divvy.zip"
    end

**Note:** the install action is default.

#### Install App To Custom Destination

    zip_app_package "GitHub" do
      source      "https://github-central.s3.amazonaws.com/mac/GitHub%20for%20Mac%201.0.6.zip"
      checksum    "1e95b3c16915efe171e53c2de31ae5b0b45cca6689a6923baa96cf754a06ed73"
      destination "#{ENV['HOME']}/Applications"
    end

**Note:** *GitHub.app* will be installed to `~/Applications/GitHub.app`,
and assumes that the directory exists.
